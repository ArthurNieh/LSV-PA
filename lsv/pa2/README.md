### 1. [Symmetry Checking with BDD] (50%)
Given a circuit $C$ in BDD form, an output pin $y_k$, and two input variables $x_i$ and $x_j$, 
write a procedure in ABC to check whether the output pin $y_k$ is symmetric in $x_i$ and $x_j$. 
If not, show a counterexample to prove it. 
Integrate this procedure into ABC (under "src/ext-lsv/"), so that after reading in a circuit (by command `read`) and transforming it into BDD (by command `collapse`), running the command `lsv_sym_bdd` would invoke your code. The command should have the following format.
```
lsv_sym_bdd <k> <i> <j>
```
where $k$ is the output pin index starting from 0, and $i$ and $j$ are input variable indexes starting from 0. 
If the $k$-th output is symmetric in the $i$-th and the $j$-th variable, just print `symmetric`, as shown below.
```
symmetric
```
Otherwise, print `asymmetric` and show a counterexample in the following format.
```
symmetric
<pattern 1>
<pattern 2> 
```
The values in the input pattern follow the input variable order. 
Note that your counterexample should be able to prove the asymmetry. 
In other words, patterns 1 and 2 should 
(1) lead to different output values for the $k$-th output pin, and
(2) only differ in exchanging the values of the $i$-th and the $j$-th variable.

For example, suppose the BDD has only one output pin representing the function $y_0 = x_0x_1 + x_2$. The command and the output should look like:
```
abc 01> lsv_sym_bdd 0 0 1
symmetric
abc 02> lsv_sym_bdd 0 0 2
asymmetric
100
001
```
where the counterexample shows that $(x_0, x_1, x_2) = (1, 0, 0)$ and $(x_0, x_1, x_2) = (0, 0, 1)$ will lead to different $y_0$ values.

***Notice.*** When operating BDDs, remember to use `Cudd_Ref` when you create a BDD node and use `Cudd_RecursiveDeref` when you dereference a BDD node. 
This helps to avoid `cuddGarbageCollect` errors. Here is an example showing how to use these commands.
```
Ddnode* cube = Cudd_ReadOne(manager);
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    Ddnode* var = Cudd_bddIthVar(manager, i);
    Cudd_Ref(var);
    Ddnode* new_cube = Cudd_bddAnd(manager, cube, var);
    Cudd_Ref(new_cube);
    Cudd_RecursiveDeref(manager, cube);
    Cudd_RecursiveDeref(manager, var);
    cube = new_cube;
}
```

### 2. [Symmetry Checking with SAT] (50%)
Repeat Exercise 1 with all conditions being the same except that the circuit $C$ is in the form of AIG (by commands `read` and `strash`). 
Use SAT solver to check whether the output pin $y_k$ is symmetric in $x_i$ and $x_j$. 
Your procedure should implement the command in the following format.
```
lsv_sym_sat <k> <i> <j>
```
where $k$ is the output pin index starting from 0, and $i$ and $j$ are input variable indexes starting from 0. 

The output format is the same as in Exercise 1. 
For example, suppose the logic network has only one output pin representing the function $y_0 = x_0x_1 + x_2$. The command and the output should look like:
```
abc 01> lsv_sym_sat 0 0 1
symmetric
abc 02> lsv_sym_sat 0 0 2
asymmetric
100
001
```

***Hint.***
1. You can follow the following steps.
   1. Use `Abc_NtkCreateCone` to extract the cone of $y_k$.
   2. Use `Abc_NtkToDar` to derive a corresponding AIG circuit.
   3. Use `sat_solver_new` to initialize an SAT solver.
   4. Use `Cnf_Derive` to obtain the corresponding CNF formula $C_A$, which depends on variables $v_1, ..., v_n$.
   5. Use `Cnf_DataWriteIntoSolverInt` to add the CNF into the SAT solver.
   6. Use `Cnf_DataLift` to create another CNF formula $C_B$ that depends on different input variables $v_{n+1}, ..., v_{2n}$.   
Again, add the CNF into the SAT solver.
   7. For each input $x_t$ of the circuit, find its corresponding CNF variables $v_A(t)$ in $C_A$ and $v_B(t)$ in $C_B$. Set $v_A(t) = v_B(t)$ for any $t$ not in $\{i, j\}$, and set $v_A(i) = v_B(j), v_A(j) = v_B(i)$. This step can be done by adding corresponding clauses to the SAT solver.
   8. Use`sat_solver_solve` to solve the SAT problem. Note that $y_k$ is symmetric in $x_i$ and $x_j$ if and only if $v_A(y_k) âŠ• v_B(y_k)$ is unsatisfiable, where
$v_A(y_k)$ and $v_B(y_k)$ are the CNF variables in $C_A$ and $C_A$ that correspond to $y_k$.
   9. If $y_k$ is asymmetric in $x_i$ and $x_j$, use `sat_solver_var_value` to obtain the satisfying assignment, which can be used to derive the counterexample.
2. To use `Abc_NtkToDar` and `Cnf_Derive` functions, you should include the following code.
   ```
   #include "sat/cnf/cnf.h"
   extern "C"{
       Aig_Man_t* Abc_NtkToDar( Abc_Ntk_t * pNtk, int fExors, int fRegisters );
   }
   ```
3. The variable orders in CNF differ from the ones in AIG. For a pointer `pObj` in `Abc_Obj_t*` type, you can use `pCnf->pVarNums[pObj->ID]` to find its variable index in `pCnf`.
4. You can refer to our [GitHub page](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/LSV-PA/wiki/Reasoning-with-SAT-solvers) for more details about using SAT solvers in ABC.
